Enabling Internet Information Services (IIS) involves activating a Microsoft Windows feature that allows your computer to function as a web server. To do this, you typically access the "Turn Windows features on or off" settings, select IIS from the list, and then install it. This process configures your system to host websites, manage web applications, and handle various web protocols. Once enabled, IIS provides a robust platform for serving web content and applications.

It provides a user-friendly interface to download and install popular web development tools, frameworks, and platforms, such as IIS, PHP, and SQL Server. By using Web PI, you can quickly set up a development environment or deploy applications with minimal manual configuration.
